You can finally see parts of the red roof of Grannyâ€™s house 
and you feel your steps becoming lighter with the anticipation of meeting Granny after a long time.
But then that happiness soon turns into fear when you suddenly you hear a scream from inside the house. 
You drop everything and quickly head into the house, only to see a big wolf trying to devour Granny.
